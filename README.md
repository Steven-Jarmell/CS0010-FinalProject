## Data Visualization ðŸ“ˆðŸ‘€

This week we are learning about more ways to look at our data. Looking at big grids of cells and numbers is not a great way to learn anything, so how can we represent it in better ways? 


## Getting Startedâ„¢

1. In Canvas (canvas.pitt.edu), click on this class, CMPINF0010
2. Go to Modules
5. Click `Skills Lab Week 11` and click where is says `Click Here!`
6. JupyterHub should open up to this week's materials!


### If JupyterLab _really_ doesn't work for you

Use Binder:

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to your computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

Click this button to get started with Binder:

## Submitting your finished lab

We will use [Canvas](canvas.pitt.edu) to let you upload your labs. 

1. First, you're going to have to download the notebook to your computer.
    * On JupyterHub, right click on your exercise notebook on your file browser on the left
    * Click **Download** and save it somewhere

2. Then, go to Canvas to upload your lab.
    * In Canvas, click on our class, then Modules
    * Click on the Skills Lab module for this week
    * Click **Submit Assignment** in the top right
    * Choose your Notebook file you downloaded earlier (will end in `.ipynb`)
    * Hit Submit!


Note: you can re-upload your lab as many times as you want before the deadline.
