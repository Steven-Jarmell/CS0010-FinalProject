## Datasets

One dataset that we used was Fire Incidents in City of Pittsburgh. This
dataset records every time that a fire alarm occured, when it occured,
what type of fire it was, and which neighborhood it occured in, amongst
other bits of information.

Another dataset which we used is a dataset of restaurant inspections in 
Pittsburgh. This data set records the type of restaurant being inspected,
when the restaurant is inspected, where the restaurant being inspected is,
and the status of the inspection

The third and final dataset we used is a dataset which records asbestos 
permits in Pittsburgh and this shows where the permits are for as well as
if the asbestos was removed from the building or not
