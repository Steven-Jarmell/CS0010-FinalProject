## Data Visualization ðŸ“ˆðŸ‘€

This week we are learning about more ways to look at our data. How can we represent our data in better ways than just grids of numbers?


## Getting Startedâ„¢

1. In Canvas (canvas.pitt.edu), click on this class, CMPINF0010
2. Go to Modules
5. Click `Skills Lab Week 13` and click where is says `Click Here!`
6. JupyterHub should open up to this week's materials!


## If Pulse Secure doesn't work for you

Use Pitt IT's [Virtual Lab](https://www.technology.pitt.edu/services/virtual-lab). I recommend using the Web Client as listed on that website. You can download and submit files to Canvas directly from the virtual lab instance. However, if you need to get files to your local machine, you should use **OneDrive**, since it it already set up on the machine. You can then download your files to your local machine from [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/signin/).


## If JupyterLab doesn't work for you

Use Binder:

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to your computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

Click this button to get started with Binder:

## Submitting your finished lab

We will use [Canvas](canvas.pitt.edu) to let you upload your labs. 

1. First, you're going to have to download the notebook to your computer.
    * On JupyterHub, right click on your exercise notebook on your file browser on the left
    * Click **Download** and save it somewhere

2. Then, go to Canvas to upload your lab.
    * In Canvas, click on our class, then Modules
    * Click on the Skills Lab module for this week
    * Click **Submit Assignment** in the top right
    * Choose your Notebook file you downloaded earlier (will end in `.ipynb`)
    * Hit Submit!


Note: you can re-upload your lab as many times as you want before the deadline.
